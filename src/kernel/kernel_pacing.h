/*
 * kernel_pacing.h - frame pacing: the vblank schedule's arithmetic, the
 * sleeping wait that lowered guest spin loops call, and RECOMP_TRACE=pacing.
 *
 * A title that waits for its next frame in a busy loop on a counter the
 * vblank DPC moves (BLiNX 2's main loop at 0x00060475) holds a host core for
 * nothing. With `tools.recomp --spin-waits`, the generator lowers such a
 * loop's back edge to RECOMP_SPIN_WAIT(va) (templates/runtime/recomp_types.h),
 * which calls xbox_SpinWait while the pacing mode is "sleep". The kernel
 * signals xbox_SpinWake whenever guest-visible state may have changed (a
 * vblank pass, any host-run ISR or DPC, a fence write), and every wait is
 * bounded at 1 ms, so a wake the kernel never sends costs a millisecond and
 * never hangs the title. Mode "spin" (the default) returns at once: the loop
 * busy-waits exactly as the console does.
