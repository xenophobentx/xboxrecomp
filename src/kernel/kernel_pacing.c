 * The wait is a generation counter under a lock with a condition variable.
 * A waker takes the lock, bumps the generation, drops the lock and
 * broadcasts. A waiter takes the lock and sleeps only while the generation
 * still equals the one it last saw; the condition variable releases the lock
 * atomically. The generation is never read outside the lock, so:
 *  - a wake between the lifted loop's memory read and the wait has already
 *    moved the generation, and the wait returns without sleeping (no lost
 *    wake-up);
 *  - a guest store that precedes a wake in program order (the vblank DPC's
 *    bump of the frame counter, then xbox_IrqlLeaveInterrupt) is visible to
 *    the loop's next MEM32 read after the wait returns, on x86-64 and arm64,
 *    because the lock pairs the waker's release with the waiter's acquire.
 * Only a site whose writer the kernel never signals times out, and then by
 * at most SPIN_TIMEOUT_MS.

/* ── Locking the vblank to the display ─────────────────────
 *
 * RECOMP_VBLANK_SYNC=display. The emulated vblank is a host timer at
 * exactly 60 Hz; the display refreshes at its own 59.9x-60.0x Hz, from its
 * own clock. Free-running, the two drift through each other: a guest flip
 * that lands just before a display latch one second lands just after it the
 * next, and the screen repeats one frame and skips another -- the periodic
 * double/skip a FIFO swap chain only postpones. Emulators that care pace to
 * the host refresh instead (DuckStation's and PCSX2's "sync to host refresh
 * rate": when the guest rate is within a few percent of the display's, the
 * display is the clock).
 *
 * Here the vblank timer stays the clock -- a stalled or missing display
 * report never stops the title -- but its grid is moved onto the display's:
 * a present path reports each display refresh (xbox_VblankDisplayRefresh:
 * Metal's CVDisplayLink, D3D11's IDXGIOutput::WaitForVBlank, Vulkan's
 * present_wait timestamps), and each vblank's next edge is the display
 * refresh nearest one guest period on. Its period is the display's, or a
 * whole multiple of it (120 Hz: every second refresh), when that is within
 * 1% of 60 Hz; otherwise, or with no report for 250 ms, the timer runs on
 * its own 60.000 Hz grid as before. In phase with the display, a guest
 * flip's present always lands the same distance before the next latch:
 * each frame is shown exactly once.
 *
 * A path that reports only the refreshes a frame was shown at (Vulkan's
 * present_wait) gives no period, and the step between two reports is a
 * whole number of refreshes, not one: at 120 Hz a 60 Hz title's frames
 * are 16.7 ms apart, and 25 ms when one misses its refresh. Averaged, the
 * steps were the title's own frame rate -- 17.5 ms at 57 fps -- which the
 * lock then took for the display's and held the title to (BO-77). So the
 * period is the longest one every step is a whole multiple of: a step off
 * the current period's grid (25 ms on a 16.7 ms period) shows a shorter
 * one (8.3 ms), taken once three steps agree on it. */
