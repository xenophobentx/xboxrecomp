/**
 * The SDL window's Vulkan present: the zero-copy half of fb_present_sdl.c
 * when the Vulkan backend draws (RECOMP_PB_BACKEND=vulkan, not
 * RECOMP_DEBUG=vk_present=readback). The Vulkan sibling of
 * fb_present_metal.m, with the same split:
 *
 *   device         made here at window creation, before the guest starts
 *                  (nvk_core_init with the window's surface, made by
 *                  SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface); the backend adopts it at its
 *                  lazy init, so a slot image takes the backend's copy and a
 *                  present on the same queue runs after the copy it shows
 *                  (submission order; the queue lock orders the threads).
 *   slots          three BGRA8 images, frame-sized (render.scale's host
 *                  size), kept in VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL. The backend copies
 *                  its present target into the back slot on the GPU; a
 *                  guest-bytes frame is uploaded into it.
 *   present        on the main thread: the swapchain's next image, cleared to
 *                  black, the slot blitted into nv2a_present_rect's rectangle,
 *                  nearest or linear as the SDL path filters. FIFO when vsync
 *                  is on (the default), so the display paces the main thread
 *                  and never the walker, as Metal's displaySyncEnabled.
 *   shot           RECOMP_WINDOW_SHOT: the swapchain image read back after
 *                  the blit.
 *   latency        the swapchain has the fewest images the driver allows
 *                  (minImageCount, at least 2): with FIFO, one image on
 *                  screen and at most one queued, so presenting adds at most
 *                  one frame (BO-74). The slot hand-off drops a stale frame
 *                  rather than queueing it, as on Metal.
 *   timing         every present's host time, and with VK_KHR_present_id +
 *                  VK_KHR_present_wait (RADV, MoltenVK) the time each frame
 *                  reached the display, from a waiter thread: present-to-
 *                  present intervals (p50/p95/p99, frames past 1.5 refresh
 *                  periods), every 5 s under RECOMP_TRACE=present_stats and
 *                  at exit; RECOMP_TRACE=vk_present=<file> writes one CSV line
 *                  per frame. The last displayed vblank is
 *                  fbv_display_vblank().
 *
 * Thread use: fbv_create/fbv_destroy/fbv_present on the main thread,
 * fbv_slot/fbv_upload on the NV2A ack thread (each with its own command
 * pool). Every submit and present holds nvk_queue_lock.

/* ---- the post passes ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * FXAA or SMAA's three passes, then CAS (post_shaders.h, smaa.h), as
 * fullscreen-triangle passes with dynamic rendering at the frame's own size:
 * the slot (or the pass before) is the input, an image of the slot's size the
 * target, and the scale to the window then blits the last target instead of
 * the slot. GLSL compiled at the first use (the SPIR-V cache serves it
 * after), a pipeline each. A failure leaves that pass off, logged once; the
 * present is unaffected. A target exists only while its setting is on: it is
 * made at the first frame that needs it and freed (after the queue is idle)
 * when no setting does. One descriptor set per pass and frame in flight,
 * rewritten each frame: the fence wait at the top of fbv_present has retired
 * its last use.
 *
 * RECOMP_TRACE=post_gpu: each pass's GPU time, from timestamp queries around
 * it, read a frame later and averaged every 300 presents. */
