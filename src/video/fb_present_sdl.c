/**
 * Show the presented frames in a window: the POSIX half of fb_present.c.
 *
 * fb_present.c is Win32 GDI and runs its window on a thread of its own. That
 * cannot work on macOS, where AppKit -- and so SDL's video and event pump --
 * only runs on the process main thread, and the guest used to own that thread
 * for the whole run. So the shape is inverted here:
 *
 *   process main thread   SDL window, the one SDL event loop, input
 *   "present" pthread     the layer presenters' presents (Vulkan, Metal)
 *   "guest-main" pthread  the boot sequence and the recompiled entry point
 *
 * The present thread waits on the frame slots' condition variable for a new
 * frame or a request from the main thread (redraw, quit; frame_wake.h), so
 * no frame waits for SDL's event pump, which under gamescope's Xwayland can
 * block for a whole frame and more (BO-210). The main thread hands it what
 * it needs of the window (presentable or not; on macOS the layer's size and
 * the display, fbm_main_tick) and the overlay's input; AppKit and the
 * window's lifecycle stay on the main thread. The SDL renderer path (no
 * layer) still presents on the main thread.
 *
 * xbox_HostWindowMain() does the inversion: it opens the window, starts the
 * guest on a pthread with the main thread's stack size and QoS, starts the
 * present thread, and pumps events until the guest returns or the window is
 * closed.
 *
 * Frames come from the backend's flip (cpu_on_flip calls
 * xbox_FramebufferWindowPresent on the nv2a-ack thread, with the surface the
 * walker picked). The ack thread copies the finished surface into a free
 * slot of three and publishes it with a pointer swap under a mutex held for a
 * few instructions, so the walker never waits for the window and the window
 * never reads guest memory the rasteriser may be writing. The copy is the
 * same bytes RECOMP_FB_DUMP writes (bpp from pitch / width, 2 = R5G6B5,
 * 4 = X8R8G8B8), so the window shows what the dump shows.
 *
 * With RECOMP_PB_BACKEND=metal the window is a CAMetalLayer instead
 * (fb_present_metal.m; metal_present=readback keeps the SDL renderer): the
 * presenter owns the Metal device and queue and the backend adopts them
 * (xbox_FramebufferWindowMetal), so a frame drawn on the GPU reaches the
 * window by a blit into the back slot's texture
 * (xbox_FramebufferWindowBackTexture, then PublishTexture, inside the same
 * s_in_present handshake) and never through guest memory. Guest-bytes frames are uploaded into a slot. When the
 * layer cannot be set up, the window is re-created with the SDL renderer.
 *
 * With RECOMP_PB_BACKEND=vulkan the same shape on a Vulkan swapchain
 * (fb_present_vulkan.c; vk_present=readback keeps the SDL renderer): the
 * presenter makes the shared Vulkan device with the window's surface
 * (SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface) and the backend adopts it, slots are images the
 * backend copies its frame into, and the main thread presents them FIFO.
 *
 * The settings overlay (src/overlay, overlay.h) rides on both layer presenters:
 * every event of the loop goes to it first (main thread), it is drawn into the
 * drawable after the game's image (present thread), and while it is open the
 * present thread presents on every turn, not only on a new game frame. The
 * SDL renderer path has none.
 *
 * RECOMP_HEADLESS=1 (or no display, or SDL video failing to start) skips all
 * of it: the guest runs on the main thread exactly as before.
 *
 * Knobs: RECOMP_PRESENT_VSYNC=0 presents without waiting for the display;
 * RECOMP_PRESENT_STATS=1 prints a [PRESENT] line every 5 s (one is always
 * printed at exit); RECOMP_WINDOW_SCALE=<n> sizes the window (default 2).
 *
 * RECOMP_PRESENT_TIMING=legacy|auto (display.present_timing): when a frame is
 * handed to the display, on the CAMetalLayer path (fb_present_metal.m and
 * src/kernel/present_cadence.h, BO-115). Each frame carries its emulated
 * vblank from the publish to its first present; the Metal presenter records
 * when frames reach the glass for the overlay's graph, and
 * RECOMP_TRACE=glass=<file> writes them out. The Vulkan presenter is as it
 * was: its graph says "not available".
 *
 * RECOMP_WINDOW_SHOT=<flip>[,<flip>...]: read back what the renderer drew for
 * the frame of that walker flip count (the number RECOMP_FB_DUMP_FLIPS and
 * RECOMP_FLIP_LOG print), at the window's pixel size, with
 * SDL_RenderReadPixels (the layer: a blit of the drawable), into
 * <prefix>win_flip<NNNNN>.bmp. <prefix> is RECOMP_WINDOW_SHOT_PREFIX, else
 * RECOMP_FB_DUMP, else "window_". A flip the window dropped is shot at the
 * next frame it shows, under that frame's own flip number. Only the
 * process's own pixels are read.
 *
 * RECOMP_WINDOW_QUIT_AFTER=<seconds>: post SDL_QUIT then, the event the
 * window's close button produces, so a script can test the close path.
 *
 * Enhancements (nv2a_host_opts, set by the opt-in layer's
 * xbox_enhance_init; all zero without it): present.filter = linear sets the
 * frame texture's scale mode on the same logical-size letterbox; integer
 * draws the frame at the largest whole multiple that fits, centred
 * (nv2a_present_rect; a frame larger than the window falls back to a
 * linear fit, never a crop, which is why SDL_RenderSetIntegerScale is not
 * used); present.fullscreen opens the window borderless fullscreen on the
 * desktop. The default (nearest, windowed) runs exactly the code it always
 * did.
 *
 * The window title is the title's to choose: call xbox_HostWindowSetTitle()
 * before xbox_HostWindowMain(). Unset, it is the XBE certificate's name, or
 * "Xbox Recomp" before the loader has read one. RECOMP_TRACE=title appends
 * FPS and draws, once a second (window_title.h).
