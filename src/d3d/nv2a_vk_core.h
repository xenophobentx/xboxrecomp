/**
 * The Vulkan device the pushbuffer executor's Vulkan backend (nv2a_pb_vulkan.c)
 * draws with and the SDL window's Vulkan presenter (src/video/
 * fb_present_vulkan.c) shows frames with: one instance, one physical device,
 * one logical device, one graphics queue.
 *
 * The window is made first, on the process main thread, before the guest
 * starts: its presenter calls nvk_core_init() with the instance extensions
 * SDL wants and a callback that makes the surface (SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface),
 * so the device is picked for a queue that can present there. The backend
 * initialises lazily on the NV2A ack thread and adopts that device; headless,
 * it calls nvk_core_init() itself, without a surface.
 *
 * The queue is shared by two threads (the ack thread's submits, the main
 * thread's presents), so every vkQueueSubmit and vkQueuePresentKHR on it
 * holds nvk_queue_lock(). Submission order on the one queue is what orders
 * a backend blit into a window slot before the present that reads it.
 *
 * Requires Vulkan 1.3 (dynamic rendering, synchronization2, extended dynamic
 * state, timeline semaphores): RADV on the Steam Deck and MoltenVK 1.2.11+.
