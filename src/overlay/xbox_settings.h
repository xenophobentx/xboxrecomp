/*
 * xbox_settings.h - the settings the in-game overlay edits, and settings.toml.
 *
 * Every setting is one of the runtime's RECOMP_* knobs (recomp_env.h) with a
 * key in the settings file, a type, a range and, where the runtime can take
 * it while running, a live apply. The precedence, high to low:
 *
 *   1. the environment: a RECOMP_* variable the user set; the overlay shows
 *      the setting locked
 *   2. settings.toml in the save directory (recomp_save_dir.h), or the file
 *      RECOMP_SETTINGS names; "none" reads and writes no file
 *   3. the title's defaults (the host's env_default calls, passed to
 *      xbox_SettingsGameDefault), then the toolkit's
 *
 * The file is applied by setting the variables, so every reader of the
 * environment (the backends, the window, the enhancements layer, which then
 * ranks the file over enhance.toml) sees it without knowing it exists.
 * Order in a host's main:
 *
 *   xbox_SettingsInit("Burnout3");       // first: before the defaults
 *   env_default(...) + xbox_SettingsGameDefault(name, value) for each
 *   xbox_SettingsFinish();               // after the last default
 *
 * Only settings the user changed are written; the rest follow the defaults.
 * TOML, not INI: the enhancements layer already reads it (recomp_cfg.h), the
 * file has typed values and sections, and enhance.toml is the same shape.
 * The overlay rewrites the whole file; comments in it are not kept.
 *
 * Values are doubles here: a bool is 0/1, a choice its index.
