/*
 * overlay_ui.cpp - the settings overlay: hotkeys, pause, input routing, the
 * pages and the frame-time graph. See overlay.h.
 *
 * Opening it does three things, on the main thread, in this order: the title
 * stops reading pads and keys (xbox_InputSetBlocked, input_core.c), the title
 * is paused (xbox_HostPause, kernel_pause.h: the GPU thread holds at the next
 * flip, the APU's frame thread idles), and the presenter starts presenting on
 * every turn. Closing undoes them, writes the settings, and keeps the pad
 * neutral until its buttons are let go (the press that closed it is not the
 * title's).
 *
 * The navigation is the overlay's own, not ImGui's: ImGui is the renderer
 * and the mouse. A pad, key or stick event becomes one step on a row (up,
 * down, left, right, activate, back, page, default), with key repeat for a
 * held direction, so what a button does does not depend on ImGui's focus
 * rules. Rows are drawn as ImGui items so the mouse works the same way.
